Well, hopefully we've done enough to get you up and running with Lithium development, but that's never the whole story! I'd recommend you do some research into:

* Source control (e.g. Git)
* PHP performance and configuration
* Scaling
* Hosting
* ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)
* Programming paradigms
** OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
** AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
** FP (Functional Programming)

## Specific things to read:

* [http://unassumingphp.com/lithium-getting-stuff-from-your-database/](http://unassumingphp.com/lithium-getting-stuff-from-your-database/)
* http://www.komposta.net/article/lithium-model-schema-caching - cache schema
* https://github.com/heptat/li3_ruckusing_migrations?
* http://www.slideshare.net/nateabele/lithium-the-framework-for-people-who-hate-frameworks - presentation from Nate Abele on Lithium. A few years old but still worth a browse.
* https://sites.google.com/a/mattvanandel.com/lithium-framework/home - very old now but still mostly accurate

## Places to get help

* IRC - join #li3 on FreeNode IRC to chat about Li3 and get advice.
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) a good place to ask questions, with the added benefit that it helps others in future who have the same problem!

> **Note on filters** Here we've seen, for the first time, the concept of a **Filter**. The [Lithium docs on filters](http://li3.me/docs/manual/lithium-basics/filters.wiki) are worth reading - filters are a very powerful concept in Lithium, rooted in AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming).
