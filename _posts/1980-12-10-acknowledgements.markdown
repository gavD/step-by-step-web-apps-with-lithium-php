Thanks to [Dayle Rees](http://daylerees.com/) for the encouragement in my writing - he was instrumental helping me publish [Deal With It](https://leanpub.com/dealwithit/).

Big up [Warren, Carey, Craig, Jenko and Rod - team Unified Diff](http://unifieddiff.co.uk/)! Tech meetups are an important part of being a software developer and I'm glad we have this!

Thanks to my parents for their constant support and my girl for somehow making me braver.

thanks to the #li3 room on Freenode, especially rapzo, wms and niftydigits, for helping test the book!

If you [bought this book](https://leanpub.com/step-by-step-lithium-php/), thanks to you! If you read it for free on line, that's cool as well, please consider dropping the price of a can of RedBull on buying a copy to help to support me to write more books!
