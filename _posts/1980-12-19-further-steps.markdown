Well, hopefully we've done enough to get you up and running with Li3 development, but that's never the whole story! I'd recommend you do some research into:

* Source control (e.g. Git)
* PHP performance and configuration
* Scaling
* Hosting
* ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)
* Programming paradigms
** OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
** AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
** FP (Functional Programming)
